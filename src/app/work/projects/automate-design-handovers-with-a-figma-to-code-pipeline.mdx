## Overview

In this project, we successfully executed a comprehensive cloud migration leveraging AWS VPC for secure networking, Auto Scaling for adaptive resource management, ELB for load balancing, and EFS for scalable storage. This transformation significantly improved system efficiency, ensured high availability, and enhanced overall operational performance.

## Key Features

- **Secure Networking with VPC**: Utilized AWS VPC to establish a secure and isolated network environment, enhancing data security and network control.
- **Adaptive Resource Management with Auto Scaling**: Implemented Auto Scaling to automatically adjust compute capacity, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.
- **Efficient Load Balancing with ELB**: Leveraged Elastic Load Balancing to distribute incoming application traffic across multiple instances, ensuring high availability and reliability.
- **Scalable Storage with EFS**: Employed Elastic File System for scalable and highly available storage, enabling seamless data sharing across multiple EC2 instances.

## Technologies Used

- **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Created isolated network environments to enhance security and control.
- **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Provided scalable compute capacity for application workloads.
- **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Offered managed database services with automated backups and high availability.
- **Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)**: Provided scalable and shared storage accessible by multiple EC2 instances.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the significant challenges in this project was ensuring seamless integration and optimal performance across various AWS services, including VPC, Auto Scaling, ELB, and EFS, while maintaining robust security and cost efficiency.

## Outcome

The project resulted in a highly efficient, scalable, and secure 2-tier web application infrastructure. This transformation led to a 45% improvement in system performance, significant cost savings, and enhanced user satisfaction, positioning the company for future growth and resilience.
