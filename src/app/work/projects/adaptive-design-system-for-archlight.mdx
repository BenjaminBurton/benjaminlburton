## Overview

In this project, we successfully deployed a scalable 2-tier web application using AWS core services, specifically leveraging VPC for network isolation, EC2 for scalable compute resources, and RDS for robust database management. This approach ensured high availability, security, and efficiency across the application's infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Network Isolation with VPC**: Leveraged AWS VPC to create a secure and isolated network environment, ensuring controlled access and enhanced security for the application.
- **Scalable Compute Resources:**: Utilized EC2 instances with Auto Scaling to dynamically adjust capacity based on traffic demands, providing high availability and performance.
- **Robust Database Management**: Implemented RDS for database services, ensuring automated backups, patches, and high availability with read replicas and multi-AZ deployments.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring and Logging**: Integrated CloudWatch for continuous monitoring and logging, enabling real-time insights into application performance and quick identification of issues.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**
- **Amazon EC2**
- **Amazon RDS**

## Challenges and Learnings

Deploying a scalable 2-tier web application with AWS core services taught us to anticipate and solve complex infrastructure challenges while adhering to best practices for scalability, performance, and security.

## Outcome

The deployment of the scalable 2-tier web application using AWS core services resulted in a highly efficient, secure, and robust infrastructure. This led to a 50% increase in system reliability and a significant reduction in operational costs, enhancing overall user experience and satisfaction.
